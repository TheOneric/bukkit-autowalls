# AutoWalls (Bukkit-Plugin)

This plugin was actively supported by me from May 2013 to mid 2014 and 
continued to work at least a few years longer. I don't know if/how this still 
works with up-to-date CraftBukkit/Spigot/Sponge or similar.

The last officially released binary build was tested against 
`CraftBukkit-1.7.2-R0.3`. (iirc)

# Dev-Bukkit
The dev-bukkkit page is here, but over the course of several account transfers 
(currently twitch) I lost acces to my original account and can't edit the 
informations there anymore.
On dev-bukkit the license is `All Rights reserved`, **this has been 
superseeded** by a relicense, **all versions** are now available under GPLv3.
Also I'm no longer supporting the plugin myself, you are however free to fork 
and carry on the plugin under the terms of the GPLv3, should you choose so.
Have Fun!  And let the games begin.
